## Features 


### Existing Features 

**Navigation Bar**

- The navigation bar allows easy access around the site and includes links to the sections: About Us, Times and Prices, and Contact Us. 
- As the website is a single page which scrolls the links take the user to the relevant section. 


**Landing Page Image**

- The landing includes the name of the gym and brief welcome message.

- There is an eyecatching image of a woman bouldering to help emphasise the purpose of the website.



**General Information Section**

- There is an 'about us' section which gives information about the centre. This section aims to answer some questions which users may have whilst also exciting an interest in using the facilities. 

- There is a 'story' section that gives a bit of a story about the centre's background. The 'walls' section gives specific information about what climbing there is available. Then the final section is about the general facilities that the club has on offer. These are facilities that will increase convenience and comfort of users and so are good to mention here. 

- The background image is a close up of hands belaying. This is to again reinforce the purpose of the page. It also serves to emphasise that Rocks Off is not just a bouldering centre, but also has roped climbing opportunities.

### Features left to implement 

- The site could also include a gear shop online in the fuuture. This would complement the on-site gear shop mentioned in the facilities box in the about us section. 



## Testing

### Validator Testing 

Html and CSS were tested on [W3C HTML code validator] (https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS code validator] (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). 

**Html**

An issue was flagged with aria labels in the code validator. The aria attributes were not correct. The issue was that I had just put 'aria' and not 'aria-label'. This was an easy enough fix. Re-running the code through the validator found no issues. 


**CSS**

The validator found no issues with the CSS.
